Contributing
============

Dear all,

This is my first public library. 
It may be imperfect or incomplete, and it needs the skills of passionated developpers like you !

Any contribution is welcome! But please try to stick with these following guidelines.

## For Users

Please use the [issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) when opening a new issue!

Think you discovered a bug?
Please provide a precise description of the problem, and maybe a reproduction of the issue.

## For Developers

#### Before opening the pull request

Obviously, please use the [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) when opening a pull request!

Try to keep the changes minimal and focus on the essentials.
A small and focused changeset is more likely to be merged than a large one!

Of course, please write the tests for your code.
You can run tests with `npm run test`, `npm run test:watch` or `npm run test:ci`
